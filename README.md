# üéôÔ∏è AuroraDuke Accent Detector

This project is a Python-based application that detects the **English accent** from a given audio file. It provides two interfaces:

- A modern **web interface** using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- A classic **desktop interface** using `Tkinter`

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AuroraDuke/AuroraDuke-Accent-Detector-rem.git
cd AuroraDuke-Accent-Detector-rem
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment and Install Requirements

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üíª Running the Application

### ‚û§ For the Streamlit Web Interface

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_accent_app.py
```

This will launch a web app in your browser, where you can upload `.wav` audio files and view the predicted accent along with a confidence score.

### ‚û§ For the Tkinter Desktop Interface

```bash
python accent-win.py
```

A GUI window will open, allowing you to select an audio file, analyze it, and optionally export the results to a CSV file.

## üß† Model Information

This project uses the [Jzuluaga/accent-id-commonaccent_xlsr-en-english](https://huggingface.co/Jzuluaga/accent-id-commonaccent_xlsr-en-english) model from Hugging Face. The model is based on the **Wav2Vec 2.0 XLSR** architecture and is fine-tuned for English accent recognition using the CommonVoice dataset.

### ‚úÖ Recognized Accents

The model can classify the following English accents:

- `us`
- `england`
- `australia`
- `indian`
- `canada`
- `bermuda`
- `scotland`
- `african`
- `ireland`
- `newzealand`
- `wales`
- `malaysia`
- `philippines`
- `singapore`
- `hongkong`
- `southatlandtic`

It achieves high accuracy (up to 95%) in accent classification tasks. For technical insights, refer to the [CommonAccent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18283).
